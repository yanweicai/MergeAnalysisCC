Merge analysis tests whether the QTL signal identified by haplotype association can be explained by the pattern of alleles at a known variant by comparing the fit of the founder allele haplotype model with a simpler “merged” model in which haplotypes carrying the same variant allele are forced to have the same haplotype effect, or equivalently, haplotypes with the same allele are “merged”. 

This repository is specifically designed to run merge analysis in the Colloabrative Cross mice, with data organized specifially as http://github.com/danoreper/ISVdb

The example here use a toy example and run by
```R
Rscript MergeExample.r
```
